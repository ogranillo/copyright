		<title>Is Copyright Fair?</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		I argue that copyright is fair. Why you ask? Well to sum it up, I think copyright gives people an incentive to keep creating. 
    Without copyright I think the drive wouldn't be there.
    The reason why I say this is because it gives people a sence of accomplishment and intellectual property.
    Copyright is very important for this very reason in my opinion.
